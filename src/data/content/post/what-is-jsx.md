JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript, making React components easier to visualize and structure.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

Under the hood, JSX is transformed into `React.createElement` calls.

### Why use JSX?
- Clear syntax
- Easier to write UI components
- Great developer experience

JSX isn't required in React, but it's highly recommended for readability and maintainability.
