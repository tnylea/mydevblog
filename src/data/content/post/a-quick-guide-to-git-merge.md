`git merge` is a fundamental Git command used to combine the changes from one branch into another. It helps teams and individuals bring together work from different branches in a project.

## What is `git merge`?
- **Purpose:** Integrates the changes from a source branch (like a feature branch) into a target branch (such as `main` or `master`).
- **How it works:** Git tries to automatically combine the histories of both branches. If the same lines were changed in both branches, you may get a merge conflict that you’ll need to resolve manually.

## When to Use `git merge`
- When you’ve finished a feature branch and want to bring those changes into your main branch.
- When you want to incorporate the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch.

## How to Use `git merge`
1. **Switch to the branch you want to merge into:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. **Merge the other branch:**
   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```
   This will merge `feature-branch` into `main`.

3. **Resolve any conflicts:**
   If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. Open the conflicted files, make the necessary edits, then:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit
   ```

## Example
```bash
git checkout main
git merge add-login-form
```

If there are no conflicts, Git will create a new merge commit. If there are conflicts, Git will tell you which files need to be fixed.

## Best Practices & Tips
- Always pull the latest changes before merging: `git pull`
- Use `git status` to monitor the merge process.
- For updating your feature branch with the latest from `main`, run `git merge main` while on your feature branch.
- Write clear commit messages when resolving conflicts.

Merging is a safe and common way to combine code. With a little practice, you’ll be able to manage branches and code changes with confidence!
